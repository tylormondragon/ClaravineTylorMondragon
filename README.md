## API ANSWER

## There are several API recommendations I could make for this webpage
1. Add a GET endpoint that would retrieve all products and their metadata in the product catalog
2. Add a GET endpoint to retrieve any/all product(s) in the shopping cart
3. Add a GET endpoint that takes a parameter of a product name/id and returns just the product information for that single product
4. Add a POST endpoint to create a new product in the product catalog
5. Add a PUT? endpoint to delete the contents of the cart and empty it
6. Add a POST endpoint that takes a product id/name and submits an order based on the response body passed in (quantity etc)
